# ## Plotting the distribution of activation magnitudes
# As the forward pass progresses through the network, the residual
# stream tends to increase in magnitude in an exponential fashion. This
# is easily visible in the histogram below, which shows the distribution
# of activation magnitudes for each layer of the network. The activation
# distribution translates by an almost constant factor each 6 layers,
# and the x-axis (magnitude) is log-scale, so magnitude apparently
# increases exponentially with layer number.
# 
# (Intriguingly, there are a few outlier residual streams which have
# magnitude over an order of magnitude larger than the rest.)
